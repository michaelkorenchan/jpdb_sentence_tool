In this folder is a json file describing the public API of a Japanese-learning tool called JPDB. JPDB provides a personal database of spaced-repetition vocabulary cards, among other features. However, JPDB is missing a feature that would very much help my study, so I'd like you to help me investigate whether it would be possible to implement this feature with an external tool that calls the public API.
The JPDB cards that I study are per-word, and I generate them using JPDB's "new deck from text" feature where I provide input text, and JPDB automatically parses the text for words, organizes those words into known/unknown/etc., and generates a deck of vocabulary cards for study. So far this works just fine.
JPDB cards also include an example sentence for the target word. This sentence is usally provided/generated by JPDB's database of sentences, but there is also a feature that allows the user to provide a custom sentence.
The problem is that when I create a new deck from text, I want the card for each "new/unseen" word from that text to include the exact sentence that it was used in, rather than a random one. It seems instead that each card must have it's sentence set manually; this is the feature I'd like you to help me implement with this tool.
So please first read trough jpdb.json to understand the API, then help me build a CLI tool that does the following:
- Takes a user-provided text file
- Creates a new deck from the input text using JPDB's "new deck from text" feature.
- For each "new" word's card in the newly-created deck, set its custom sentence to the sentence from the text containing the first occurence of that word.
